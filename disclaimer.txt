Dear Travis guy,

I am Daniele, psycopg maintainer, and I'm using Travis to try and create OSX
builds for psycopg2.

Because I don't know much about OSX, and because there is a long backlog of
works on OSX (https://www.traviscistatus.com/) it will take me a lot of time
and frustration to get the build script right. As such I'm attempting to ssh
into a Travis machine so I can type commands interactively. I'm trying to do
so by reverse tunneling into a server under my control.

I hope this is not a problem for you: if it is please contact me
(daniele.varrazzo (at) gmail.com) and I will stop immediately.

Thank you for your support. Also, I like your moustache.

Sincerely,

	Daniele
